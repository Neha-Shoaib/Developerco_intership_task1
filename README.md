# Developerco_intership_task1 – Partial Submission

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the initial implementation of the assigned internship task.  
Due to unavoidable academic commitments, the task could not be completed fully within the given time.

## ⚠️ Reason for Incomplete Work
During the task period, my **final semester examinations** were ongoing. These exams are crucial as my **CGPA depends on them**, and they are scheduled to continue **until 25rd January**.  
Because of this, I was unable to allocate sufficient time to complete all the required pages.

## ✅ Current Progress
- Successfully completed **1 page** of the assigned task.
- The completed page demonstrates my understanding of the task requirements and coding standards.

## 🕒 Future Plan
Once my exams conclude:
- I will complete the remaining pages.
- Improve structure, styling, and functionality where required.
- Ensure the final submission fully meets the internship task requirements.

## 🙏 Note
I sincerely apologize for the incomplete submission and appreciate your understanding.  
This internship is important to me, and I am fully committed to completing the task properly after my exams.

Thank you for your patience and support.
